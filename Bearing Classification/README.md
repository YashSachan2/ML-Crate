## DESCRIPTION

This project aims to identify the faulty and helthy bearings.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Data collection: From the link of the dataset given above. 
2. Data preprocessing: Preprocessed the data to create valid features.
3. Model selection: XGBC,Random Forest,Logestic Regression,Gaussian Bayes,AdaBoost Classifier.
4. Comparative analysis: Compared the accuracy score of all the models.


## MODELS SUMMARY

- XGBC
- Logistic Regression
- Adaboost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Bayes

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn

## EVALUATION METRICS

The evaluation metrics I used to assess the models:

- Accuracy 

It is shown using Confusion Matrix in the Images folder

## RESULTS
Results on Val dataset:
XGBC: 77.33%
Random Forest: 77.67%
Adaboost: 75%
Logistic Regression: 74%
Gaussian Bayes: 73.33%
DTC:77.33%
